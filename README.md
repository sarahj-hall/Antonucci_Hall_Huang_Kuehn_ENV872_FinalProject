## Summary

This repository contains code and data for the investigators' Duke Nicholas School of the Environment ENVIRON872 Environmental Data Exploration Final Course Project in the Fall of 2025. The data used for analysis was event-correlated power outage data from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). Temporal trends in the number and length of power outages were analyzed for CA, TX, FL, PA from 2015 to 2023.

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>

## Investigators

Addisen Antonucci, Sarah Hall, Carina Huang, and Isabelle Kuehn

## Keywords

power outages, trend, time series analysis, power-system, black-out, reliability

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

The data set was downloaded from the Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI), and the outage data set version 2 was accessed 11/15/2025. This data set is located in the Data/Raw folder. Processed data was wrangled in RStudio and written into Data/Processed folder in the repository.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 
Folders in this repository include: Code, Output, Data/Raw, and Data/Processed. The Code folder contains the R scripts used to complete our analyses, these are in .Rmd files. The Output folder contains all figures and the final PDF of the project. The Data/Raw folder contains the original data sets, and the Data/Processed contains the wrangled data. All data was downloaded and processed into csv format. 

Naming conventions:
based on raw data?
processed
state seperated?

## Metadata

<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column. Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.>
